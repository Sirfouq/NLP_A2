    "## N-Gram Language Modeling\n",
    "In the second assignment, you will implement an **n-gram language model** that processes input text to generate, analyze, and calculate the probabilities of sequences of `n` words (n-grams). This model will tokenize text, create n-grams, and compute their frequencies and probabilities, returning the most frequent n-grams in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tokenization**: Convert the input text into a list of words (tokens).\n",
    "2. **N-gram Generation**: Create sequences of `n` tokens from the text, treating each sentence independently with the inclusion of start (`<s>`) and end (`</s>`) markers.\n",
    "3. **Frequency Counting**: Count how many times each n-gram appears in the text.\n",
    "4. **Probability Calculation**: Compute the probabilities of each n-gram based on its frequency and add alpha smoothing to improve generalization of items.\n",
    "5. **Most Frequent N-grams**: Return the most frequent n-grams along with their probabilities, helping to identify common patterns in the text."

    "In this section, we use the previously trained **n-gram model** to calculate a **co-occurrence matrix**. A co-occurrence matrix shows how often words appear together within a specific context (in this case, bigrams), providing insights into word relationships in the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. **Tokenization and N-gram Generation**: We first tokenize the text and generate bigrams using the `NGramModel`.\n",
    "2. **Vocabulary and Indexing**: The vocabulary is created from the unique tokens, and a word-to-index mapping is established.\n",
    "3. **Co-occurrence Matrix**: Using the generated n-grams, we compute the co-occurrence matrix, where each entry represents how often two words occur together within the bigrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "The co-occurrence matrix provides a numerical representation of word relationships, which is useful for tasks like word embeddings, semantic analysis, and understanding word associations."

    "## Prediction-Based Word Vectors\n",
    "In this section, we load pre-trained word vectors using the **GloVe** embeddings from the [Stanford NLP paper on GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf). The pre-trained embeddings provide rich semantic information about words based on large text corpora, allowing us to represent words as vectors that capture their meaning and relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. **Load GloVe Word Vectors**: We use the GloVe embeddings from the `glove-wiki-gigaword-200` model, which has 200-dimensional vectors for each word.\n",
    "2. **Vocabulary Matching**: We map the words from our corpus to the GloVe vocabulary and extract the corresponding vectors.\n",
    "3. **Dimensionality Reduction**: After obtaining the word vectors, we reduce the dimensionality to visualize the embeddings in 2D space, allowing us to explore word relationships visually.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an excellent opportunity to explore how pre-trained embeddings like GloVe can be used to improve downstream NLP tasks by providing richer word representations."

    "### Words with multiple meanings\n",
    "Polysemes and homonyms are words that have more than one meaning (see [this wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysemy) to learn more about the difference between polysemes and homonyms). Your task is to find a word with at least two different meanings such that the top-10 most similar words (according to cosine similarity) contain related words from both meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- \"leaves\" has both the \"go_away\" and \"a_structure_of_a_plant\" meanings in the top 10.\n",
    "- \"scoop\" has both \"handed_waffle_cone\" and \"lowdown\" meanings in the top 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will probably need to try several polysemous or homonymic words before you find one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you discover a word that fits this criterion, state the word and explain the multiple meanings that occur in the top 10. Reflect on why many of the polysemous or homonymic words you tried didn’t work (i.e., why the top-10 most similar words only contain one of the word's meanings).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Use the `wv_from_bin.most_similar(word)` function to get the top 10 most similar words. This function ranks all other words in the vocabulary based on their cosine similarity to the given word. For further assistance, you can refer to the [Gensim documentation](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/keyedvectors.html)."

    "### Bias in word vectors\n",
    "a. **Observation**: Consider the results of a word vector model when queried with analogies involving \"man\", \"woman\", and \"profession\". What are the top results returned by the model for each query?\n",
    "\n",
    "When querying the analogy \"man is to profession as woman is to x\", the top result is \"professions\", followed by words like \"practitioner\", \"teaching\", \"nursing\", and \"teacher\", which are commonly associated with stereotypically female-dominated fields. In contrast, reversing the analogy — \"woman is to profession as man is to x\" — returns terms like \"reputation\", \"skill\", \"ethic\", \"business\", and \"respected\", which reflect more abstract or prestigious associations. The differences in results highlight a noticeable asymmetry in the model's treatment of gendered professional associations.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. **Analysis**: Do you observe any gender biases in the results? For example, are certain professions more closely associated with \"man\" or \"woman\" based on the word vectors? Discuss how word embeddings might perpetuate societal biases present in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results suggest the presence of gender bias in the word vectors, where professional roles and qualities associated with \"man\" tend to reflect status, ability, and business-oriented language, while those associated with \"woman\" lean toward caregiving, education, and traditionally female occupations. This reflects and reinforces societal stereotypes embedded in the data used to train the embeddings, rather than presenting a neutral or equitable view of professional roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. **Reflection**: How might such biases affect the fairness of machine learning models that use word embeddings? Suggest potential strategies for mitigating gender bias in word vector models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Biases like these in word embeddings can lead to unfair or stereotyped assumptions in downstream NLP tasks, such as résumé screening, chatbot behavior, or content recommendation systems. They risk perpetuating historical inequalities by encoding them into systems that appear objective. To mitigate this, developers can apply debiasing techniques, use balanced or filtered corpora, or incorporate fairness-aware evaluation metrics to identify and reduce representational harm in word vector models."

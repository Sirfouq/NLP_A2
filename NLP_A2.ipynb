This model will tokenize text, create n-grams, and compute their frequencies and probabilities, returning the most frequent n-grams in the text.\n",

    "3. **Frequency Counting**: Count how many times each n-gram appears in the text.\n",
    "4. **Probability Calculation**: Compute the probabilities of each n-gram based on its frequency and add alpha smoothing to improve generalization of items.\n",
